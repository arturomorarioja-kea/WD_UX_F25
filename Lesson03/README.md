## In-class exercise

### Project Gutenberg - API consumption
Create an application that consumes the `books` endpoint of [Gutendex](https://gutendex.com/) (the Project Gutenberg API) and displays a series of book cards including book title, authors (notice that there can be more than one), cover image, description (there can be more than one, but just use the first one; notice that there can be no description, so account for it), and a link to the HTML version of the book in the Project Gutenberg page.

[## Homework]: #

[### Information Architecture]: #
[- Check out the slides on **IA Navigation and Wayfinding**, with especial attention to:]: #
[  - Navigation structures]: #
[  - Wayfinding methods (breadcrumbs, URL structures, CTAs, landmarks and mega menus)]: #
[- Do the following exercise in groups of 4 students:]: #
[  - Find at least one website example of each one of the following wayfinding resources:]: #
[    - Breadcrumbs]: #
[    - URL structures]: #
[    - Calls to action]: #
[    - Consistency in the use of landmarks]: #
[    - Mega menus]: #
[  - Show your findings to the class next week]: #

[### First Mandatory Assignment(https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=1344451)]: #
[- Do the *Music CDs* exercise(https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=1344535). When submitting, specify whether you want individual feedback]: #
[- Start working on the *API consumption* exercise(https://kea-fronter.itslearning.com/LearningToolElement/ViewLearningToolElement.aspx?LearningToolElementId=1344536). Take the following into account]: #
[  - You need to sign up to TMDB(https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) (The Movie DataBase) in order to get an API key]: #
[  - Find the endpoints you need in TMDB's API Reference(https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started):]: #
[!image(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45b18cd9-aca3-4b46-bfa2-a90e44dd8bad)]: #
[  - Before implementing the corresponding `fetch()` requests, read each endpoint's documentation in the central and right side of the page]: #
[  - Try to optimize your code so that you do not need to make four independent `fetch()` requests]: #
