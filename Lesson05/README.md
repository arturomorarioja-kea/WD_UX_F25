[User Experience - Spring 2025](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-kea/WD_UX_F25/blob/main/README.md)

# Lesson 5 - 27 February

[## First Mandatory Assignment solutions]: #
[- Restaurant(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/kea_css_restaurant_solution)]: #
[- Music CDs(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/kea_js_music_cds_solution)]: #

[General feedback. Things to improve]: #
[- Code should be divided into folders. As projects tend to grow, file organisation can soon become unmanageable]: #
[- HTML5 code should not be mixed with XHTML code (e.g., it is `<img>`, not `<img />`]: #
[- The submit button in a form must always be either an `<input>` or a `<button>` of `type="submit"`, so that an event listener is added to the `submit` event of the form instead of to the `click` event of the button]: #
[- When an element will repeat in the page (e.g., the delete row button), it should have a class instead of an id, as ids must be unique]: #
[- CSS custom properties (variables) must be used for all colours and fonts, and they must be used consistently: just one hardcoded colour can cause grave problems regarding code maintainability]: #
[- In the listener of a form's submit event, input information must be gathered with `e.target.elementID` instead of `document.querySelector(`#elementID`). It is faster and more structured]: #
