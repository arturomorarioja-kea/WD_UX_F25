[--> feedback: explain response error handling]: #

[## First Mandatory Assignment exercise solution]: #
[- API Consumption(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/js_tmdb)]: #
[General feedback. Things to improve:]: #
[- Do never use absolute paths (e.g., `"/img"`). Use relative paths instead (e.g., `"img"` or `"./img"`)]: #
[- Try to avoid the use of `innerHTML` when injecting variable values that come from external sources (e.g., user input, an external API). Use a `<template>` and `cloneNode()` instead]: #
[- HTML5 code should not be mixed with XHTML code (e.g., it is `<img>`, not `<img />`)]: #
[- CSS custom properties (variables) must be used for all colours and fonts, and they must be used consistently: just one hardcoded colour can cause grave problems regarding code maintainability]: #
[- Do not expose your private API key in a public GitHub repo. Anyone can steal it and try to attack TMDB on your behalf]: #
[- We are using JavaScript modules, so `DOMContentLoaded` is not necessary. Modules are loaded deferredly by default, so they will start executing only after the DOM content has been loaded]: #

[Next week we are adding another API, this one internal, for user and favourites management. Find it here(https://github.com/arturomorarioja/food_repo_users_api_v2) and check out its endpoint and installation explanations at `README.md`]: #
