# Lesson 1 - 30 January

## Software installation
**Microsoft Visual Studio Code**

Download Visual Studio Code (you can also download more Microsoft software) from [Microsoft Azure for Education](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools). Log in with your KEA credentials.

Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)
- [htmltagwrap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradgashler.htmltagwrap)
- [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)

Many developers use [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot), but I would prefer you to write and “prettify” your code yourselves so that you have full control over it, especially now that you are learning.

**Git and GitHub**

Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/), the most popular SCM (Source Code Management) tool. Check out the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

If you still do not have it, create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/), the main code repository platform.

If you just want to try some small code projects to illustrate specific CSS or JavaScript features, you can try a lightweight front-end platform like [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
